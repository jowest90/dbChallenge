website with a java program to modify sql database
The Webiste folder contains the src code of my website which can be viewed here, https://polar-temple-98151.herokuapp.com/
All it shows is a list of emails.
The Java folder contains the source code and an executable, when run, will generate a report of all emails listed in the database of that website.
